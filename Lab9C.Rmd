This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
```{r}
library(multtest);data("golub")
subset<-golub[,golub.cl == 1]
Subset10<-head(subset,10)
Subset10

```
```{r}
means <-apply(Subset10,1,mean)
i = Subset10[order(apply(Subset10,1,mean),decreasing = T)]
SubsetS = Subset10[order(means, decreasing = TRUE),]
SubsetS
```

```{r}
SubSD<-apply(SubsetS,2,sd)
SubSD

```
```{r}
which.max(SubsetS[5,])
```
```{r}
Col5<-ifelse(SubsetS[3,] >=0, "Positive","Negative")
Col5
```
```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
#for (i in 7:10){
  #read.table(SubsetS,header = TRUE,sep = "\t")
  plot(SubsetS[7,])
  plot(SubsetS[8,])
  plot(SubsetS[9,])
  plot(SubsetS[10,])
#}
```
```{r}
R2<-SubsetS[,2]
SubsetR<-rank(SubsetS[,2])
SubsetO<-order(SubsetS[,2])
SubserSO<-sort(SubsetS[,2])
R2
SubsetR #This ranks returns the sample ranks of the values in a vector.
SubsetO #This gives you the order that the data should be in but it does not give you the data itself.
SubserSO #This sorts your data from least to greatest. If you want to do it in descending order you would need to put descending = T. 
```
